She brought teaching experience from Central Aroostook High School, Presque Isle High School, Jackman, Penobscot Job Corps, and Beal College.  Being a true “County girl” at heart, she enjoys the small size of Orono High School, where students have the luxury of much one-on-one with their teachers.  Ms. Boyd is also the Crimson Crier Yearbook Adviser.  When not teaching,  Ms. Boyd enjoys nature and being with her family.";
