I distinctly remember reading Daniel Defoe's Moll Flanders and discussing literature in this sophomore elective that I decided to be an English major. Upon graduating from Colby, I taught English at Brunswick High School and coached football and indoor and outdoor track. I have also taught in several other schools that have given me much experience and insight into teaching literaure and writing and working with students. I taught social studies and English in Kirkland, Washington, at Lake Washington School District; Morse High School in Bath, Maine; and also taught American studies and Engish at Lawrence High School in Fairfield, Me. For the past 10 years I have taught English and social studies, coached football and baseball, and served on numerous committees for the benefit of the Orono community.";

This is how they think. For that reason, I believe that 'reading and writing should float on a sea of talk.' I do my best to foster classroom discussion that, however informal it might seem, goes somewhere. The idea is to provide students with models of good thinking, even instruction in the process of thinking, and certainly time to practice thinking through exchanges with others in class.I hold degrees in English and Microbiology and continue my apprenticeship in hockey.";
